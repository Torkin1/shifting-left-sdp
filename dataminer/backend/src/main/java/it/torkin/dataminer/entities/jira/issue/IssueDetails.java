     * NOTE: quoting the Jira API documentation:
     * 
     * > The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier
     * > doesn't match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for
     * > moved issues is performed. If a matching issue is found its 
     * > details are returned, a 302 or other redirect is not returned.
     * > The issue key returned in the response is the key of the issue found.
     * 
     * This means that we must keep the key to check if it matches with the
     * requested key, but we shouldn't store it in db since it is already
     * provided by the Issue object.
     * 
     * CAUTION: do not use this field to get the key of the issue,
     * use the key field of the Issue object instead.
     *
