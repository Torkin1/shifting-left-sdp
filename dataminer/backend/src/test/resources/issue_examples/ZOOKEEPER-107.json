The constructor could then access that URL and get the list of servers from there.  So, assuming the URL pointed to an http page, the page returned would just be \"hostA:port,hostB:port,etc\" and the client could proceed with that information.  Or, the URL could point to a local file if the server membership wasn't expected to change often.  This would eliminate the need for the clients to have any idea ahead of time of where to get the hosts.  Particularly if the information were served via http, this would move server location to being a DNS/virtualhost problem - the DNS for the server-info location could be changed if the server providing the info died.  This would go a ways toward adding a restful interface to the configuration of the cluster.\n\nSo, the client would instantiate with \nzk = new Zookeeper(new URL(\"http://zkhostinfo:7552\"), 1000, this);, \nreceive the list of hosts and work from there.  \n\nThis would address (though not solve) the issue of adding servers, as new servers could be added to the list returned to new clients.\n\nAs a corollary, the zk servers could of course serve the list of hosts as an optional part of their operation, or this function could be provided by another application, directory-style.  This would allow clients to connect to different clusters on start-up, if the directory could identify and differentiate clients by ip addr or such, and direct them to the appropriate zk group.\n\nIf this sounds (reasonable && interesting), I can open a JIRA and work on a patch to add the new constructor and client functionality.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jghoman","name":"jghoman","key":"jghoman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jghoman&avatarId=10318"},"displayName":"Jakob Homan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-07-31T22:29:45.066+0000","updated":"2008-07-31T22:30:07.822+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12619035","id":"12619035","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 I like the idea.

In other words,  I think that the QuorumPeer should not have to have any constructor args for it to know it's peers.  It should persistently store/remember what the list of peers are part of the group since it last started.\n\nNot sure if it makes sense to keep that list in the ZK db or not.\n\nWhen a node that is not part of a cluster first starts up, it needs to know if it's starting a new cluster or if it is joining an existing cluster.  Therefore, I think the QuorumPeer class needs methods like the following:\n\n{code}\n/** \n * Contacts a ZK server in the cluster, adds this peer to the cluster and gets a listing of the rest of the peers in \n * the cluster.\n *\n * Optional: is slaveOnly is true, then this peer should never be elected master.\n *\n * Throws an error if this peer is already part of a cluster.\n */ \nvoid joinCluster( URI server, bool slaveOnly )\n\n/**\n * Starts this peer as the first node in the cluster and makes him the master.\n *\n * Throws an error if this peer is already part of a cluster.\n */\nvoid createCluster()\n\n/**\n * Removes this peer from the peer list maintained by the cluster.\n *\n * Throws an error if this peer is not part of a cluster.\n */\nvoid leaveCluster()\n\n/**\n * Gets a list of peers in the cluser.\n *\n * @return null if not part of a cluster yet.\n */\nList<URI> getClusterPeers()\n{code}\n\nIf methods like the above are available, then an administrator can dynamically manage adding/removing nodes on an existing ZooKeeper cluster.  or some automated agent could do it.  Note that the peer list needs to get replicated to all cluster members and persisted to avoid split brain issues on peer restart.  Operations like joinCluster(), leaveCluster(), getClusterPeers() would block until a master is elected in the cluster.  \n\nPlease note the 'nice to have feature' where you have the ability to designate some peers as NOT being eligible to become a master.  This would allow you to support using heterogeneous peers, and enforce only allowing the higher end machines to become the masters.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram R.

Must support off-cluster getPeers operation for a recovering peer to bootstrap itself (can cache in its own persistent storage, but that could potentially be out of date by recovery time). This is probably best realised with the URI idea as before.\n\n2. Support for join and leave operation. With a quiescent cluster, join is probably as simple as a sync followed by a commit of the new peer's id to all followers (if nothing else, this ensures that if one of them should be elected the master, they know how big the quorum should be). Leaves are similar, without the sync obviously. If a peer leaves before the Leave( ) operation completes, it will look like a crash. \n\n3. If joining / leaving a cluster that doesn't have a currently elected master, block until one exists. If the cluster is currently failed due to f+1 failures, it might be necessary to timeout in order to prevent being permanently blocked if this is in the middle of a code path.\n\n4. However, if joining / leaving a cluster that has never bootstrapped it's important to do something different so as to allow the cluster to achieve a quorum. One solution is for a node to check if its id is in the list of peers at the cluster URI which will tell it if it was ever a member of the cluster previously (or part of the initial membership) and then participate in master elections. This places a requirement on the peer list to be kept reasonably accurate (but this could only affect liveness, not safety, I think).\n\nPlease chime in with comments / stuff that I've missed / bugs, otherwise I'll work on fleshing this out.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-02T00:10:53.384+0000","updated":"2009-05-02T00:10:53.384+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12705794","id":"12705794","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"sounds great henry! it would be great if you could work on this.\n\ni think we have two strategies:\n\n1) have the cluster agree on a list of servers and use the atomic broadcast to agree on changes.

I think this is the most elegant approach, and is trivially achieved by pushing join/leave requests through the atomic broadcast pipeline.\n\nIf a node is joining the cluster, it needs to be able to bootstrap the location of the cluster from somewhere. There therefore needs to be a externally available resource containing a list of machines in the cluster that is at least accurate for one machine (as a joining node will try all servers in that list in turn). When I say available at some URI, this is what I mean. Currently, this information is kept statically at a URI that addresses conf/zoo.cfg on the local filesystem. I suggest generalising that to a general URI. One nice property is that it then does not tie a cluster to a particular machine, as the URI provides a level of indirection.\n\nIt is then the cluster administrator's responsibility to keep this URI up-to-date (although of course this should be automated), possibly via a client that just pulls membership information from the cluster periodically. As I said earlier, it's only important for the contents of this list to have one node in common with the true membership of the cluster, so it's allowed to get a bit out of sync. We can certainly easily imagine ways that ZK can help here. Of course the URI must be highly available, but it also has to exist, otherwise we could have 'orphaned' clusters that are running on machines whose identity we don't necessarily know. The URI can be a front for almost any scheme we like - periodic heartbeating of live nodes is one. \n\nThe format of this file can be anything at all - from a serialised snapshot to a list of ip:port pairs, as long as it contains enough information for a client to find the cluster. Personally I would prefer human readable, simple formats.\n\nTo talk about recovery for a moment: when a node recovers from a crash and rejoins the cluster, it can help the cluster elect a master if the cluster is current non-quorate. This is because it was originally part of the cluster, and therefore the protocol guarantees that a quorum of nodes including the recovering one will have seen all committed proposals (this is important to correctness).\n\nIf the node was not originally a member of the cluster, it must not help get a master elected as it cannot be part of a quorum. Similarly, a node cannot query the cluster to find out if it was originally a member because the quorum required to do so might not exist. Therefore every node that ever successfully joins a cluster must store this fact in its own persistent storage, as only it can know whether it is permitted to help run the election. \n\nFinally, the startup problem. Given a URI, nodes can bootstrap themselves onto a cluster simply by being told to start in startup mode. Alternatively, a single node can be distinguished (again, in the URI contents perhaps) which will start in single-node mode and process join requests one-by-one. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-05T21:51:41.131+0000","updated":"2009-05-05T21:51:41.131+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12706320","id":"12706320","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"the information needed for bootstrapping is the same as the information needed for a normal zookeeper client, so it could either use the standard string that is a list of host:port pairs, or it could use the scheme proposed in ZOOKEEPER-390. with that URL it could fetch /.zookeeper/ensemble and grab the configuration information that it needs. conf/zoo.cfg isn't really a good URI for this purpose since is doesn't really have the needed client ports. plus there is information in zoo.cfg that is particular to a given server. for example, the data and log directories may be different on all the machines. the client port should also probably stay in the zoo.cfg. the server lists and probably the timing variables should probably be stored in a znode and maintained with the atomic broadcast.\n\nrecovery is a bit more than you mention, but at the same time simpler. first off, to change quorum configuration you must commit the change in both the old quorum configuration and in the new quorum configuration. for example, if you have the configuration A, B, C and you are changing to A, B, C, D, E you must be able to get quorum in both the old and new configuration for the change to work. if only A and B are up or A, D, and E are up you cannot commit the change. this means that the leader should check the new configuration carefully before proposing it, because we always roll the proposals forward, we never rollback.\n\nso really a zookeeper server doesn't know whether he is able to participate or not, the election will sort it out. a simple example is an ensemble A, B, C, D, E.

I believe this can be achieved without an out-of-band protocol or significant changes to the way the current protocols work; this has the advantage of keeping things simple. \n\nI'm not certain I've read your proposal correctly, but it seems that step 6 has followers commit the CONFIGCHANGE proposal on receipt, rather than waiting for a COMMIT message. By my understanding of ZAB, this means there is a possibility where fewer than a quorum of followers will commit this proposal, if the leader fails halfway through sending the proposal messages, leading to the possibility of divergent histories at followers. \n\nThe tool approach is one way of wrapping up the authentication required if an ensemble wishes to restrict those nodes that can join it. Currently there is some implicit authentication done as the leader only establishes connections with followers that belong to the static membership. However there's certainly a need, as a result of this JIRA, for a better authentication mechanism inside ZK. I see this as orthogonal to the mechanisms required to do dynamic membership.\n\nI suggest that we simply augment the current ZooKeeper protocol with four new proposals: NEWVIEW, GETVIEW, JOIN and LEAVE. NEWVIEW proposes an entirely new view, and may aggregate many JOIN or LEAVE proposals into one. Since NEWVIEW likely requires knowledge of the current view, GETVIEW returns the current view and its version. JOIN and LEAVE incrementally change the current view, whatever it is, and so do not require a GETVIEW call to establish the current view. \n\nAll proposals go through the usual ZAB two-phase protocol, except for the fact that the leader coordinating the current ZAB instance must wait for acknowledgements from quorums in both the current and new view before committing the change. \n\nIt's possible that this can lead to the proposal blocking if a quorum cannot be assembled in either view. Although it might seem an error that the proposal will block even if a quorum in the current view can be established, the same behaviour would be observed even if the proposal could be committed - all subsequent proposals would require a quorum from the new view and would block. \n\nIf an ensemble is currently blocked due to the failure of n/2 + 1 nodes, it is not possible to resume progress by issuing a LEAVE on behalf of the failed nodes; however in general failed nodes may both JOIN and LEAVE the ensemble. \n\nIf a leader election is required during a proposal, there are no correctness issues assuming the current required invariants of ZAB leader election hold. In particular, as long as the new leader has seen the most recent proposals then the view change proposal will be committed once the new leader is elected. This property will be maintained without changes to the current leader election protocols - as the view change proposal will have been seen by a quorum from the current view, the new leader is guaranteed to have a record of the proposal. \n\nA node that fails after it has issued a join proposal, but before it hears of its success must be able to find the status of the proposal once it recovers. There are several ways to do this. \n\nI have some sketches of correctness proofs for this and could produce a more detailed design document if required - however, if there's consensus that this is the right approach I'd rather get coding :) It turns out after much agonising that ZK's existent invariants are already pretty much strong enough to build this protocol. The only extension is the requirement to listen for two different sets of quorum acknowledgements.\n\nI've deliberately avoided the issue of exposing the view to the outside world (although this requires attention, as new nodes need to be able to find the ensemble!) - I have outlined some ideas earlier in this JIRA and I know other people have good suggestions, but I think we can solve both issues independently. \n\nWould love to hear comments, things that I've missed, errors in logic etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-15T16:56:27.973+0000","updated":"2009-06-15T16:56:27.973+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12719823","id":"12719823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Raghu, i think henry is correct that you must get an ack from quorums in both the old and new views before committing the change. otherwise you get split brain which could result in multiple leaders. henry, i think we are thinking along the same lines, but i'm a bit skeptical of JOIN and LEAVE. in some sense they are a bit of an optimization that can be implemented with GETVIEW and NEWVIEW. it would be nice to make the mechanism as simple as possible. it also seems like you would also require a GETVIEW to be done before doing a NEWVIEW, just for sanity.

They exist only to allow easy expression of what I reckon will be a common pattern: \"add my node to whatever the current cluster is\", otherwise as you say you need a GETVIEW for sanity. \n\nThere's an optimisation that would allow JOIN requests to always be committed even though the joiner might have failed - the leader can take it as read that the joiner implicitly acknowledges the JOIN proposal and can therefore push through the commit without requiring an explicit ack from it (you can show that, at least for majority quorums, the only way to have a quorum in an old view but not in the new under a JOIN is for the joiner to fail). However, since the ensemble would be failed immediately afterwards it wouldn't be much of a win.\n\nI agree that simple is better; JOIN makes the client programming simpler at the expense of the server (and saves the client a round-trip), but functionally it's subsumed by the getview->newview pattern. \n\nI like erroring out when NEWVIEW won't result in a live ensemble, or at least having that as an option.\n\n@Flavio:\n\nI definitely agree that the persisted state should be in a znode (and should therefore be exposable through watches - important for externalising membership data for bootstrapping). However, since these operations require a very slightly different protocol to normal ZAB, I'm in favour of using the opcode to tell the leader to use a protocol variant rather than the identity of the znode - this means that the arguments to 'set' or whatever are kept opaque to the Leader.

The issue I see with storing config in a znode is that the joiner needs to participate in NEWVIEW ZAB message even when it is not part of the cluster and it needs to have the latest log before it can commit the NEWVIEW  proposal since it requires writing to the log. At the same time, the leader has to make sure that it blocks all proposals in between syncing the joiner and executing NEWVIEW. I felt this could be too intrusive (may be I shouldn't have worried about this while thinking about a higher level proposal?).  Let me know if my understanding is incorrect.\n\nI don't think my proposal would result in a split brain. I believe there is no need for two phase during changing cluster configuration as long each attempt to modify the configuration generates a new version number and the cluster configuration divergence is reconciled during leader election (peers go with the configuration with the highest version number). Having a two phase is no better, since there is no guarantee that all/majority peers have committed the new configuration and there could be diverged view of cluster configuration during election.

The default leader election uses identifiers to connect and form quorums, so I'm not sure a server not in the configuration would be able to determine which replica is the leader.

It would be great to have it, since you are going through the effort of implementing it already.\n\nAs for the message to observers containing the transaction, the advantage of having a special message (e.g., INFORM) is that we cut down the number of messages to observers: INFORM is essentially a COMMIT containing the request. If we don't change the protocol, then we can just have the leader sending a PROPOSAL to everyone, including the observers. As observers will receive the COMMIT as well, we have higher message complexity.

So an Observer attaches to a leader, syncs and maybe listens in on the proposal stream for a while and then upgrades itself by issuing a view change request.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=henryr","name":"henryr","key":"henryr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henry Robinson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-21T15:16:35.323+0000","updated":"2009-06-21T15:16:35.323+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12728300","id":"12728300","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=breed","name":"breed","key":"breed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Benjamin Reed","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"sorry to jump in late here. rather than adding the inform, why don't we just send the PROPOSE and COMMIT to the Observer as normal, and just make the Observer not send ACKs?

The other side to that argument is to keep the message complexity down, especially if we can envisage use cases with lots of Observers. A connection to a remote Observer might be more likely to violate the FIFO requirement of ZK connections; having a single-message protocol makes it easier to deal with this case (not a correctness issue of Observers, just annoying if PROPOSALs arrive after COMMITs for some reason). I think that's a marginal issue though. My preference is for INFORM messages as this completely separates Observer logic from Follower logic and doesn't add much complexity to the code. \n\nThe Observer also has to take care not to participate in leader elections. I think Observers also need to announce themselves as such to the Leader, to enable the case where a Follower wishes to connect as an Observer temporarily (otherwise the Leader will think the Observer to be a Follower and use it as part of a quorum). Also if the leader can distinguish between followers and observers then it can treat both differently (e.g. through batching multiple INFORMs or allowing observers to lag by prioritising follower traffic). \n\nKeeping Observers as special-case Followers would simplify the code for the observers patch (I've got a new version nearly ready to submit, just fixing some tests). However, it would mean that Observers are harder to customise - for example, there's no persistence requirement for an Observer and so some of the RequestProcessors can be optionally removed or replaced by something that only asynchronously writes to disk. Keeping them lightweight has been a goal. My feeling was that I was introducing too many 'if (amObserver()) {...}' branches to an already fairly hard to follow bit of code (in particular Follower.followLeader). Breaking the functionality into two separate classes seems to have made things cleaner.\n\nRegarding Observers being able to issue proposals; I don't have a problem with that, should be reasonably easy to add.

E can then attempt to restart an election.

Could you comment if this makes sense?\n\n----------\n\n1. Configuration change succeeds if the change is successfully committed in both the old view and the new view. An observer is promoted to a follower only after it receives a COMMIT for the new view.\n\n2. Each peer could have two views of the cluster -- the last committed view and the last proposed view (which is created after a VIEWCHANGE proposal is received). The latter can be NULL if there is no view change attempt in progress.\n    2.A. Each peer will always attempt an election with the last committed view. Proposed views will be converted to committed views (or deleted) post leader election.\n    2.B. The proposal record of a peer contains (in addition to last logged ZXID and server ID) the last committed view of the peer\n\n3. During election, if the last committed view of the peer with the smaller ZXID (P(ZXLOW)) is different from the last committed view of the peer with the higher ZXID (P(ZXHIGH), then P(ZXLOW) adapts P(ZXHIGH)'s last committed view and broadcasts the adapted view to all other peers.\n\t3.A. Two nodes with the same ZXID should have the same committed views\n\t3.B. If the last committed views of P(ZXLOW) and P(ZXHIGH) are the same, but P(ZXHIGH) has a proposed new view (not committed yet though), that view will not be considered by both the peers during election. Similarly, if the N(ZXLOW) has a proposed view, that will not be considered either.\n\t3.C. If P(ZXLOW) adapts P(ZXHIGH)'s last committed view and that view doesn't include P(ZXLOW), P(ZXLOW) drops out of election (should it self destruct??)\n\n4. Once a leader is elected, it will sync up the logs of the followers that are lagging behind just like it's done today:\n\t- If there is a follower who's last committed view is different from the leader's, log synchronization will make sure follower's last committed view gets updated to be in sync with the leader's. Follower doesn't do anything when its last committed view changes (the new view MUST have the follower since 3.C prevents a follower that is not in the leading candidate's committed view from successfully completing an election)\n\t- If there is an observer who upon log synchronization learns that the committed view includes the observer, the observer will promote itself to a follower\n\t- If a follower with a proposed view joins an already established leader who doesn't know about that proposed view, the follower's proposed view will be erased when the leader synchronizes the followers log\n\t- If the leader has a proposed new view in its log, the leader will send a COMMIT for the new view after majority peers in the old view and the new view have synced their log to the leader's log \n\t\t4.A. The view change COMMIT doesn't mean much for the followers that are not impacted by the view change\n\t\t4.B. The observer that gets view change COMMIT will promote itself to a follower if the new view includes the observer\n\t\t4.C. The follower that gets the view change will drop out of the cluster if the new view doesn't include the follower \n\t\t4.D. The leader will drop out of the cluster once COMMIT is delivered locally if the new view doesn't include the leader. This will result in a new election.\n\t\t4.E. The leader will adjust the quorum size as per the new view otherwise.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zkuser","name":"zkuser","key":"zkuser","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghu S","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-07-16T03:02:21.108+0000","updated":"2009-07-16T03:02:21.108+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12851420","id":"12851420","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=quintonh","name":"quintonh","key":"quintonh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Quinton Hoole","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Any progress on this issue?

Every server that we put into the cluster runs a set of services that make themselves available to a local \"resource manager\" that shares the list of resources with all other servers in the cluster. When we do upgrades we simply fire up new servers with new versions of the services and connect their resource managers to the old ones into the same cluster. Then we simply shut down the old servers. Beside adding/removing servers when upgrading, we also do the same thing when we need to temporarily scale - we fire up a few more servers and connect their resource managers to the cluster to make the services available to the cluster. \nWe never know how many servers there are going to be in the cluster and we don't assign any dns entries to them (just another point of failure).\nThe clients that need to know about resources connect to any of the \"resource managers\" and get a list of all resources available and also about other \"resource managers\". As servers move around they also can connect to different \"resource manager\".\n\nThis is a bit unusual configuration since cloud practically lives on its own without any kind of static addresses. As long as you are able to connect to it at one point in time, you can keep up with it 'motion'. \n\nSo the idea was to migrate the above system to Zookeeper. Every service would connect to local Zookeeper and create ephemeral node announcing it. So every server would run its own Zookeeper node connected to the Zookeeper cloud. However without dynamic addition/removal of the servers all this becomes infeasible.\n\nIdeally we'd like to have a situation where we just start a Zookeeper node by giving it a list of known other Zookeeper nodes in the cloud. And then it should take on to the life of its own.\n\nHope that the use case helps. I am really looking forward to this!\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andraz","name":"andraz","key":"andraz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andraz Tori","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-05-20T10:36:15.174+0000","updated":"2010-05-20T10:36:15.174+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/12874234","id":"12874234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I have started a wiki page to discuss the design of this feature: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/ClusterMembership\n\nIt is not supposed to replace this jira, but instead to have a more organized way of working on the design of this feature.

Thanks for the design. I have a few suggestions/questions below.\n\nA. Bootstrapping the cluster\n    The algorithm assumes that a leader exists prior to doing a reconfig.\nSo it looks like the reconfig() API is not intended to use for bootstrapping\nthe cluster. How about we define a API for initializing the cluster? \n\nInstead of relying on the current method of setting the initial configuration\nin the config file, we should probably also have to define a join(M) (or\ninit(M)) API. When a peer receives this request, it will try to connect to the\nspecified peers.  During bootstrap peers will connect to each other (as they do\nnow) and elect a leader.\n\nB. Storing membership in znode and updating client (a tangential topic to this\ndesign).\n    Earlier ZOOKEEPER-107 proposed of using a URI based approach for the\nclients to fetch server list. I am not opposed to the URI based approach,\nhowever, that shouldn't be our only approach. URI based approach requires extra\nresources (e.g., fault tolerant web service or shared storage for file, etc).\nIn certain environments it may not be feasible to have such a resource.\nInstead, can we use a mechanism similar to ZooKeeper watchpoints for this?\nStore the membership information in a znode and let the ZooKeeper server inform\nthe clients of the changed configuration.\n\nC. Locating most recent config on servers\n    The URI based approach will be more helpful to servers. For example, if\nA was down when M={A, B, C} was changed to M'={A, D, E}, then when A comes\nonline it won't be able to locate the most recent config. In this case, A can\nquery the URI. Second approach is to ask the leader to try to periodically\nsend the membership (at least to nodes that are down).\n\nD. \"Send a message to all members(M’) instructing them to connect to leader(M).\"\n    leader(M) can potentially change after sending this message. Should\nthis be \"Send a messages to all members(M') to connect to members(M)? See\npoint G. below.\n\nAlso, in step 7, why do you send leader(M') along with <activate-config>message>?\n\nE. \"3. Submit a reconfig(M’) operation to leader(M)\"\n    What if leader(M) fails after receiving the request, but before\ninforming any other peer? How will the administrative client know whether to\nretry or not?  Should s retry if leader fails and should the client API retry\nif s fails? \n\nF. Regarding 3.a and 3.b.\n\nThe algorithm mentions:\n\n\"3. Otherwise:\n   a. Designate the most up-to-date server in connected quorum of M' to be leader(M)\n   b. Stop processing new operations, return failure for any further ops received\"\n\nWhy do we need to change the leader if leader(M) is not in M'? How about we let\nthe leader perform the reconfig and at the end of phase 3 (while processing\nretire) the leader will give up leadership. This will cause a new leader\nelection and one of the peer in M' will become the leader. Similarly, after the\nsecond phase, members(M') will stop following leader(M) if leader(M) is not in\nM'. I think this will be simpler.\n\nG. Online VS offline\n\n    In your \"Online vs offline\" section, you mentioned that the offline\nstrategy is preferred. I think we can do reconfiguration online.\nI pictured M' as modified OBSERVERS till the time the reconfiguration is complete.\n\na. Let new members(M') join the cluster as OBSERVERS. Based on the current\nimplementation, M' will essentially sync with the leader after becoming\nOBSERVERS and it will be easier to leverage the RequestProcessor pipeline for\nreconfig.\n\nb. Once a majority of M' join the leader, the leader executes phase 1 as you\ndescribed.\n\nc. After phase 1., the leader changes the transaction logic a bit. Every\ntransaction after this point (including reconfig-start) will be sent to M and\nM'.  Leader then waits for quorum(M) and quorum(M') to ack the transaction. So\nM' are not pure OBSERVERS as we think today. However, only a member of M can\nbecome a leader until reconfig succeeds.  Also, M' - (M n M') cannot serve\nclient requests until reconfiguration is complete. By doing a transaction on\nboth M and M' and waiting for the quorum of each set to ack, we keep transfering\nthe state to both the configurations.\n\nd. After receiving ack for phase 2, the leader sends <switch-to-new-config>\ntransaction to M and M' (instead of sending retire just to M).\n\nAfter receiving this message, M' will close connections with (and reject\nconnections from) members not in M'.  Members that are supposed to leave the\ncluster will shutdown QuorumPeer. If leader(M) is not in M', then a new\nleader(M') will be elected.\n\nLet me know what you think about this.\n\nH. What happens if a majority of M' keep failing during reconfig?\n\nM={A, B}, M'={A, C, D, E}. What if D, E fail?\n\nFailure of a majority of M' will permanently stall reconfig. While this is\nless likely to happen, I think ZooKeeper should handle this\nautomatically. After a few retries, we should abort reconfig.  Otherwise, we\ncould disrupt a running cluster and we will never be able to recover without\nmanual intervention. If the majority fails after phase 1, then this would mean\nsending a <abort-reconfig, version(M), M'> to M.\n\nOf course, one can argue - what if majority of M' fail after phase 3? So not\nsure if this is an overkill, but I feel we should handle this case.\n\nI. \"Old reconfiguration request\"\n\na. We should use ZAB\nb. A side note - I think ZOOKEEPER-335 needs to be resolved for reconfig to\nwork. This bug causes logs to diverge if ZK leader fails before sending\nPROPOSALs to followers (see\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/zookeeper-user@hadoop.apache.org/msg00403.html).\n\nBecause of this bug we could run into the following scenario:\n- A peer B that was leader when reconfig(M') was issued will have reconfig M'\n  in its transaction log.\n- A peer C that became leader after B's failure, can have reconfig(M'') in its\n  log.\n- Now, if B and C fail (say both reboot), then the outcome of reconfig will\n  depend on which node takes leadership. If B becomes a leader, then out come\nis M'. If C becomes a leader, then outcome is M''\n\nJ. Policies/ sanity checks\n- Should we allow removal of a peer in a 3 node configuration? How about in a\n2-node configuration?\n\nCan you please add section numbers to the design paper? It will be easier to\nrefer to the text by numbers.\n\nThanks again for working on this. We are about to release the first version of\nour product using ZooKeeper, which uses static configuration. Our next version\nis heavily dependent on dynamic membership. We will be happy to chip in from our\nside to help with the implementation.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-03-14T18:43:24.526+0000","updated":"2011-03-14T18:43:24.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13006716","id":"13006716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Vishal,\n\nThanks a lot for your comments and for offering to help. I have some experience with reconfigurable solutions however\nI'm new to the ZooKeeper project and your help will be very appreciated. I suggest to start by figuring out what we'd \nlike to do and then we can decide who does what. \n\nAs you suggested I numbered the sections so it's easier to refer to. Some of the things you point out are very important but I think they are separate from the core design so we can address them separately.\n\nA. I agree that bootstrapping the cluster should probably be done this way, but this seems like a separate issue - in this case the reconfiguration is very simple since the state is empty and we can block until the configuration connects. One related thing - in my proposal I suggested that the server that gets the reconfig request from a client sends a message to members(M') instructing them to connect to leader(M). This can be done by invoking a join(M) command on the servers.\n\nB. This is an important issue and I definitely agree we should discuss this, but I think this is also orthogonal to any solution we choose now.\n\nC. Agree, second approach looks good (leader periodically broadcasts membership, or at least the configuration id).\n\nD. The purpose of connecting is only to begin state transfer, so only connecting to the leader matters. For example, there is no need\nfor members(M) to detect failure of new servers that are trying to connect. If the leader fails then the new leader can be responsible for establishing connections to members(M') as part of completing the reconfiguration (see first step in Section 4.2).\n\n> Also, in step 7, why do you send leader(M') along with <activate-config> message?\n\nThe idea is that there is no need to explicitly run leader election in M' - the old leader can appoint one of members(M') to be the new leader (the new leader should be chosen s.t. it is up-to-date with M). This way leader election in M' is only required if the designated leader fails. Including leader(M') in the phase-3 message instructs it to start acting as leader of M'.\n\nE. This is very related to ZOOKEEPER-22 (how does a client know whether its operation has been executed if the leader failed) ?\nIn this case though, it should be easy to detected whether the reconfiguration was completed or not - the recovery procedure will have the property that when a new leader is established then either the new leader has observed the reconfiguration attempt and completed it or no further leader will (if we fix ZOOKEEPER-335 :)).  \n\nWe should provide a way to query for the current configuration, both for the issue you mention and also for non-incremental reconfig API (I suggest that a client invoking a reconfig request should include the version of the current config in the request and if this config is no longer the current its request should be aborted, Section 4.3).\n\nF. This is exactly what I meant - I think you didn't notice the \"’\" (it says \"to be leader(M’)\").\n\nG. I agree that online would be better. I initially thought that it's not possible in this case, but now I think there's a way.\n\n> a. Let new members(M') join the cluster as OBSERVERS. Based on the\n> current implementation, M' will essentially sync with the leader after becoming\n> OBSERVERS and it will be easier to leverage the RequestProcessor pipeline for reconfig.\n\nThis was also my intention - to let them connect to the leader and perform state transfer before the leader is requested to reconfigure.\n\n> b. Once a majority of M' join the leader, the leader executes phase 1 as you described.\n\nI think a reconfig operations should be sent to the leader only after a majority of M' has connected to it. This way we avoid waiting\nfor this to happen in the leader code. The leader can check whether a majority is connected and not too far behind with regard to\nstate transfer and abort otherwise (line 1 in the algorithm).\n\n> c. After phase 1., the leader changes the transaction logic a bit. Every transaction after this point (including reconfig-start) will be sent to M and M'.  \n> Leader then waits for quorum(M) and quorum(M') to ack the transaction. So M' are not pure OBSERVERS as we think today. However, only a member of\n> M can become a leader until reconfig succeeds.  Also, M' - (M n M') cannot serve client requests until reconfiguration is complete. By doing a\n> transaction on both M and M' and waiting for the quorum of each set to ack, we keep transferring the state to both the configurations.\n> d. After receiving ack for phase 2, the leader sends <switch-to-new-config> transaction to M and M' (instead of sending retire just to M).\n> After receiving this message, M' will close connections with (and reject connections from) members not in M'.  Members that are supposed to\n> leave the cluster will shutdown QuorumPeer. \n\nHere are some issues that I see with your proposal:\n\n1. Suppose that leader(M) fails while sending phase-3 messages and all phase-3 messages arrive to members(M) but none arrive to members(M'). Now the system is stuck: M' - (M n M') cannot serve client requests whereas members(M) are no longer in the system.\nThis is why I think before garbage-collecting M we must make sure that M' is operational by itself. \n\n2. In my proposal members(M') can accept operations as soon as they get the phase-2 message, which is the purpose of phase 2. \nI don't see why phase-2 is needed in your proposal. I suggest to stick with 3 phases s.t. phase-2 message allows M' to be independent.\n\n3. Because of Global Primary Order property of ZAB we can't allow a commit message to arrive from leader(M) to members(M') after they are allowed to process\nmessages independently in M'. Your solution handles this because members(M') close connections to leader(M) as soon as they're allowed to process messages independently, but then its not clear how the outstanding ops get committed. In order to commit these operations nevertheless so I suggest that this would be the task of leader(M'). \n \nHere's what I suggest:\n\n- after leader(M) sends phase-1 message to members(M) it starts sending every received new op to both members(M) and members(M') (treating them as followers). Commit messages must not be sent to members(M') by leader(M) and sending such messages to members(M) does not hurt but is not necessary. In any case, clients are not acked regarding these ops. \n\n- As soon as enough acks are received for the phase-1 message from members(M), leader(M) sends a phase-2 message to members(M') and from this moment doesn't accept new ops (unless leader(M) is also in M' and therefore acts also as leader(M')).\n \n- When members(M') receive the phase-2 message from leader(M) they send an ack both to leader(M) and to leader(M') - in practice it can send an ack to leader(M) first, then disconnect from it and then connect to leader(M') and send an ack to it but it doesn't matter for correctness. When leader(M') receives this ack from a quorum of members(M') (as well as the phase-2 message from leader(M)) it can commit all preceding ops in M'. \n\nThe thing is, until ZOOKEEPER-22 is fixed the fact that we're processing ops in M' doesn't really help since the clients won't be able to know that the ops got committed.\n\nH.  I agree - it's an overkill :)  We can make sure that a quorum of M' is connected when the reconfiguration starts.\n\nI.  I agree - it is important to fix ZOOKEEPER-335 (as well as ZOOKEEPER-22).\n\nJ. As long as a quorum of the old and the new config are up during the reconfig it seems like we can do the reconfig (e.g., the majority of 2 is 2). Currently a warning is issued if there are 2 nodes in a configuration, we can do that too. Actually, we need to define liveness more carefully, it's on my ToDo list :)\n\nBest Regards,\nAlex\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-03-14T23:24:33.266+0000","updated":"2011-03-14T23:24:33.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13007297","id":"13007297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I updated the algorithm and section 4.1, and added some points for discussion as section 4.7\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ClusterMembership\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-03-16T00:30:50.620+0000","updated":"2011-03-16T00:30:50.620+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13011450","id":"13011450","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Alex,\n\nThanks for the updated design. Some comments below. Some of these might be\nrepetition of what we discussed earlier. I am adding them here so that we\nhave it on the jira.\n\n{quote}\nD. The purpose of connecting is only to begin state transfer, so only\nconnecting to the leader matters.  for members(M) to detect failure of new\nservers that are trying to connect. If the leader fails then the new leader can\nbe responsible for establishing connections to members(M') as part of\ncompleting the reconfiguration (see first step in Section 4.2).\n{quote}\n\nWhat will M' do if the leader(M) fails? We could run into a scenario where M'\ndon't know about leader(M) and leader(M) may not know about M'. So it might\nbe easier to ask M' to connect to M. Essentially, we need a way to figure out\nwho the current leader is. We could potentially run the virtual IP based\napproach that I mentioned earlier. Let the leader runs a \"cluster IP\" and\nanyone (including ZK clients) that wants to get cluster/leader information can\nsend query to this IP.\n\n{quote}\nthe old leader can appoint one of members(M') to be the new leader (the new leader\nshould be chosen s.t. it is up-to-date with M). This way leader election in M'\nis only required if the designated leader fails.\n{quote}\n\nI am not in favor of this approach. May I suggest that from implementation\nperspective, we leave this\nin future work/ improvements section? It certainly is a good optimization, but\nI don't see it giving us significant benefits. IMHO, it seems a bit counter\nintuitive for node x to designate node y as a leader in a distributed protocol\nthat is designed to elect leaders. I find it easier to think \"elect a leader if\nyou need one\". I am also concerned that this is going to make the\nimplementation prone to strange corner cases and more complex (to test as well).\n\n{quote}\nE. This is very related to ZOOKEEPER-22 (how does a client know whether its\noperation has been executed if the leader failed) ?\n{quote}\n\nAgreed. However, the client library attempts to reconnect to the servers.\nAlso, the application can verify if the transaction is done when it\nreconnects next time.  We may have to do something similar as well. \n\n{quote}\nreconfiguration attempt and completed it or no further leader will (if we fix\nZOOKEEPER-335 )\n{quote}\n\nWhy should we not fix ZOOKEEPER-335? Won't the log divergence cause\nunpredictable outcome of reconfiguration? log of A has M' and log of B has M''.\nDepending upon who wins election the configuration will be either M' or M''.\n\n{quote}\nI think a reconfig operations should be sent to the leader only after a\nmajority of M' has connected to it.\n{quote}\n\nSure, though (as you pointed out) this is not strictly necessary for the\ncorrectness of the protocol.\n\n{quote}\nHere are some issues that I see with your proposal:\n\n1. Suppose that leader(M) fails while sending phase-3 messages and all phase-3 messages arrive to members(M) but none arrive to members(M'). Now the system is stuck: M' - (M n M') cannot serve client requests whereas members(M) are no longer in the system.\nThis is why I think before garbage-collecting M we must make sure that M' is operational by itself.\n{quote}\n\nCould this be fixed by sending the message to M' first and then sending to M\nafter receiving ack from majority of M'\n\n{quote}\n2. In my proposal members(M') can accept operations as soon as they get the phase-2 message, which is the purpose of phase 2.\nI don't see why phase-2 is needed in your proposal. I suggest to stick with 3 phases s.t. phase-2 message allows M' to be independent.\n\n3. Because of Global Primary Order property of ZAB we can't allow a commit message to arrive from leader(M) to members(M') after they are allowed to process\nmessages independently in M'. Your solution handles this because members(M') close connections to leader(M) as soon as they're allowed to process messages independently, but then its not clear how the outstanding ops get committed. In order to commit these operations nevertheless so I suggest that this would be the task of leader(M').\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n    * after leader(M) sends phase-1 message to members(M) it starts sending every received new op to both members(M) and members(M') (treating them as followers). Commit messages must not be sent to members(M') by leader(M) and sending such messages to members(M) does not hurt but is not necessary. In any case, clients are not acked regarding these ops.\n\n    * As soon as enough acks are received for the phase-1 message from members(M), leader(M) sends a phase-2 message to members(M') and from this moment doesn't accept new ops (unless leader(M) is also in M' and therefore acts also as leader(M')).\n\n    * When members(M') receive the phase-2 message from leader(M) they send an ack both to leader(M) and to leader(M') - in practice it can send an ack to leader(M) first, then disconnect from it and then connect to leader(M') and send an ack to it but it doesn't matter for correctness. When leader(M') receives this ack from a quorum of members(M') (as well as the phase-2 message from leader(M)) it can commit all preceding ops in M'.\n{quote}\n\nThere are subtle differences between the protocol that I suggested and your\nproposal. I am not fully convinced if the changes are necessary. I might be\nmissing something here. I will get in touch with you offline for further\nclarification. \n\nThere are a few problems in the revised protocol posted on the wiki:\n\n1. leader(M) does not wait for confirmation of ongoing transactions from\nmajority of M' (during phase 1). How do you guarantee that once M' starts\nleader election all the transactions that are committed to M are also committed\nto M? A majority of M' might be lagging behind and one of them might end up\nbecoming the leader(M').\n\n2. Why is Step 8. (\"Stop processing new operations, return failure for any\nfurther ops received\") necessary? The protocol that I suggested does not reject\nany transactions from the clients. In the most common case of reconfiguration,\nonly a subset (very likely 1) of the peers would be added/removed. So ZK\nclient library can reconnect to one of the other ZK servers using the same\ncode that it does today. As a result, the application will not even notice that\na reconfiguration has happened (other than potentially receiving notifications\nabout the new configuration).  \n\n{quote}\nH. I agree - it's an overkill We can make sure that a quorum of M' is connected\nwhen the reconfiguration starts.\n{quote}\n\nWhat should we tell the administrator to do if majority of M' fail during\nreconfiguration? During normal operations, if a majority of nodes fail, then\nthe admin has a choice to copy the DB from one of the live nodes to rest of the\nnodes and get the cluster going immediately. There is a risk of loosing some\ntransactions, but there is also a chance that the one of the node has\nreasonably up-to-date copy of the data tree.  However, during reconfiguration\nif majority of M' fail the cluster is unrecoverable even if majority of M are\nonline.

Before phase 2, M' does nothing - M will elect a new leader and that leader\nwill either complete the reconfiguration if it find traces of it stored by phase-1 in M, or otherwise will \nabandon it (in which case s or the client will perhaps re-submit it). As part of the recovery protocol (see twiki),\nthe new leader instructs members(M') to connect to it, similarly to the way s originally instructed them to connect to \nthe old leader(M).\n\nIf leader(M) fails after a phase-2 message arrived to some process in M', that process will forward the message\nto the rest of M'. If this process fails before/during forwarding, this means that M still has a quorum and we're in the same\ncase as described above. Otherwise, members(M') will get this message and run leader election. According to what\nI suggested, leader election will not be run if the appointed leader(M') is up. Anyway, I think that after getting the\nPhase-2 (activation) message, a process in M' will not agree to connect to M, instead it tries to convince the rest of M' to start running.\n\n> appointing a leader\n\nThis seems like an important optimization that can be easily done since the leader has a quorum of responsive members from M', he can just pick one of them and save leader election. All this means is that before running leader election in M' a process will attempt to connect to the appointed leader(M'), and if this fails they'll still run the leader election. Admittedly, I don't yet fully understand the code,\nso I might be wrong and this might in fact turn out to be too complicated.\n\n> clients \n\nWe were discussing this point with Flavio a bit, and there are some initial ideas.

If a quorum of M' cannot connect before reconfiguration begins,\nwe can abort the reconfiguration. If they fail during phase-1, we can continue in M and shouldn't start M' until quorum M' is up.\nIf they fail during phase-2, leader(M) will not be able to complete phase-2, so M will not be garbage-collected, although the system is stuck. If phase-2 completes then M' is active and a quorum of M' has all the state, and M can be garbage-collected. Here, I don't see the difference from a normal execution without reconfigurations. \n\nBest Regards,\nAlex\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-03-26T00:17:05.334+0000","updated":"2011-03-26T00:17:05.334+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13012561","id":"13012561","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vishalmlst","name":"vishalmlst","key":"vishalmlst","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vishal Kher","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{quote}\nWe were discussing this point with Flavio a bit, and there are some initial ideas.

One simple way to do this is to let s use incremental API if there are too many clients. Replacing one by one will result in gradual transfer of clients.\n\nAlso, after step 7 of the algorithm (before phase 2) how about we ask leader(M) to do a transactions using zab (or consider reconfig-start as that transaction) to write out M' in zookeeper tree.

You must specify all client ports in that file - this info is separated by \";\" from the usual server info (client ports were made part of the configuration info so that when clients find out about new configurations they know how to connect to the servers). The cfg file can still include client ports (or hostname and port, but if given they must be the same as in the members file.\n\nThere are 2 new commands - \"config\" that gets the new configuration and \"reconfig\" that changes the configuration. config has just one option \"-c\" which returns just the version of the configuration and connection string interesting to clients. reconfig has many options and you can change all ports and server roles in the members file. For example in the ZK shell:\n\n> reconfig -remove 1 -add 5=localhost:1234:1235:observer;1236\n> reconfig -file new.members\n> reconfig -remove 3 -from 123456   (reconfigure only if the current config is 123456)\n\nBy doing \"-add \" and giving different ports/role to a server that is already in the cluster, you'll change its ports/role. \n\nClients can subscribe to membership changes (membership is stored in a special znode, ZooDefs.CONFIG_NODE), and update the Zookeeper handle by executing \n\"zk.updateServerList(hostList);\" See src/java/systest/ReconfigClient.java or GenerateLoad.java for an example.\n\nI intend to update the algorithm to get better load balancing when new servers are added to the system (current method spreads load well only when a servers are removed).\n\nAlex\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-12T04:54:20.882+0000","updated":"2011-09-12T04:54:20.882+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13102425","id":"13102425","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Use C naming conventions. Specifically:\n\nzhandle_t *zh,  char **joiningServers, int numJoiners, char **leavingServers, int numLeaving, char *newMembers, int newMembersLen, int64_t fromConfig, char *buffer, int* buffer_len\n\nThis should be:\n\nzhandle_t *zh,  char **joining_servers, int num_joiners, char **leaving_servers, int num_leaving, char *new_members, int new_membersLen, int64_t from_config, char *buffer, int* buffer_len\n\n2. The C code tries very hard to keep the line lengths at 80 characters. A lot of your code does not.\n\n3. I think that joiningServers and leavingServers should be const as certainly you aren't changing these in the C code. And it wouldn't make sense for the contract of these functions if you ever needed to. It also makes it easier to call from C++ code where I can create a vector then pass it's contents into the C code without having to const-cast things.\n\n4. newMembers is badly named since it's a FILE. Should be e.g. newMembershipFile or something\n\n5. newMembersLen is also badly named as it's the length of the *filename* not the length of the new members themselves.\n\n6. fromConfig should have more meaningful name like old_version.\n\n7. I totally don't understand the purpose of buffer and buffer_len arguments. Why would they ever be anything other than the list I provided? This seems unecessary. Moreover, I don't see why you'd expose the raw contents of this buffer to the caller.\n\n8. What's the purpose of the stat argument? Not sure I understand the use case for why I'd want the stat structure of the underlying /zookeeper/config path. Or is this just for getting the version of that znode?\n\n9. I find the combination of the non-incremental and incremental arguments into the same function overly complicated. Specifically if you're giving the \"newMembership\" arguments the rest are ignored (or must be NULL) but if you're in incremental mode, the non-incremental args must be NULL. Easy to get that wrong or at least be confused by this. I think it'd be cleaner to have a separate interface for the nonincremental mode... perhaps a zoo_reconfig and a zoo_reconfig_nonincremental or zoo_reconfig_fromfile or some such.\n\nSince I'm doing a lot of improvements to the C code already, let me know your thoughts on the above and I'll make the necessary changes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2012-03-21T07:00:16.610+0000","updated":"2012-03-21T07:00:16.610+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13234416","id":"13234416","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shralex","name":"shralex","key":"shralex","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Shraer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Marshall,\n\nThanks for the comments. Regarding 7 - zoo_getconfig was made to be very similar to zoo_get, except that it doesn't get a path as parameter and reads the special configuration znode. As the comments in the code say, the buffer holds the configuration returned by the server and buffer_len is the size of the \"returned\" buffer. Similarly the answer to 8 is that it was made to be similar to zoo_get. The configuration version is actually part of the returned config data itself, although (if I remember correctly) it should be identical to the znode version. Its something that is also stored in the membership file and used for comparing configs, so its always part of the config.\n\nI would be happy if you fix the other issues you raised. Would you like to update the last patch here and upload it ?\nI'd actually be happy to pass the C part to you entirely, I'm just not sure how that could work in JIRA.\n\nThanks,\nAlex\n\nP.S. this JIRA is not for inclusion.

We (www.solidfire.com) use Zookeeper as our database for a distributed scale-out block storage system.  We deploy fully automated clusters from 3 to 25+ nodes that must be able to self heal ensemble issues after inevitable node failures.  We maintain an ensemble of 3 or 5 nodes, so if one of these ensemble nodes fails we require another node in the cluster to assume its duties as quickly as possible.  Prior to this patch, the only way to reconfigure the ensemble was to do a typical \"rolling restart\" of the Zookeeper process on each of the nodes after modifying the local configuration file, but manually adjusting the ensemble wasn't an option.  Automating this was a challenge though since Zookeeper also contained our authoritative node list (chicken and egg), which meant that cascading failures could easily lead to inconsistencies in configuration files and then the ensemble could get easily confused.  Additionally, the re-connection events caused by restarting servers complicated the centralized logic that was coordinating the reconfiguration.\n\nThis is where Zookeeper-107 has been a life saver.  We integrated this patch into our production version of Zookeeper-3.5.0 about a year ago and have been running with it since.  The simplicity of the interface and the reliability it has shown have made handling ensemble node failures significantly easier.  We exclusively use the c-client and have not had any problems with it.  Currently we only use the \"full reconfiguration\" functionality rather than the \"incremental\" reconfiguration.  In integrating this functionality with our coordination code, all of the problems we ran into were *ours* and the patch showed solid resilience to the many error scenarios we've thrown at it. Furthermore, Alex was super helpful and responsive in helping us integrate this into our environment. Eventually we want to write up a small white paper on exactly how we manage our ensemble, but we don't have the time right now.\n\nJust to give some perspective on the amount of stress this patch has gotten in our codebase, here are some stats.  The reconfiguration code has ran 10,000+ times within our integration testing and product qualification environments.  The sorts of tests we have in our integration testing environment are heavily focused on reconfiguring the ensemble while there are concurrent operations in flight simultaneously with the reconfiguration operation. We've never seen an operation fail or get missed in any way during the reconfiguration. We also have an extensive set of tests which essentially create a three node ensemble and then add two more nodes and grow the ensemble to 5. The test has two different Zookeeper clients -- one connected to the original set of 3 and one connected to the new set of 2 that is joining the ensemble. While we are reconfiguring the ensemble to grow from 3 to 5 we hammer the original 3 nodes with write operations. Once the reconfiguration is complete, we validate that the new 2 nodes see all the operations submitted to the original 3 nodes. We've never seen any problems with any of our tests!\n\nGiven its stability in house, we are now actively deploying Zookeeper-3.5.0 with this patch to several customers running production environments (and many more running test environments), which combined with our internal test environment means we have this software running on 200+ nodes in 25-50+ clusters at any one time.  Our website shows the importance these customers place on our software, so you can be sure we've tested it extensively in hundreds of different reconfiguration scenarios, and we haven't had to file a single jira yet.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=marshall","name":"marshall","key":"marshall","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marshall McMullen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2013-01-30T20:49:22.927+0000","updated":"2013-01-30T20:49:22.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12401266/comment/13567098","id":"13567098","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fpj","name":"fpj","key":"fpj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=fpj&avatarId=16030"},"displayName":"Flavio Paiva Junqueira","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks for sharing your experience, Marshall.
